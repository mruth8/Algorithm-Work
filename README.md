# Algorithm Work
I introduced a Stanford data set into a project where I wrote dijkstra, printpath, and landmark functions in a C++ implementation of a graph for a final project in one of my computer science courses.
More detailed descriptions of the project and functions are contained in the [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuUFBdm4RP0&feature=youtu.be).
